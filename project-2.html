       <h5>Project Overview</h5>
       <div>
           Based on historical data, IAS's Data Science team created a set benchmarks that mapped exposure time 
           (time of user being exposed to an ad) to opportunity to influence an ad consumer. Our team was tasked 
           to create a new UI that would help our clients with analysis and decision making based on the new set 
           of metrics. In about 10 weeks, we designed and built a brand new dashboard, while dealing with limitations 
           of legacy UI, complex set of requirements and multiple edge cases.
       </div>

       <h5>My Role</h5>
       <div>
           I've lead all of the UX efforts, working with VP of Product, Tech Lead, Sales and Marketing. Conducted 
           user interviews, facilitated workshops and created wireframes/prototypes. Tracked KPIs. Worked with the 
           scrum team throughout the implementation phase.
       </div>

       <h5>Research</h5>
       <div>To kick off the project, I've conducted discovery interviews with a several of our UI super-users. 
       Below are the main takeaways:</div>
       <ul>
           <li>Clients find Time-in-view data is interesting, but hard to understand</li>
           <li>Time-in-view data is valuable only if it provides user with actionable insights</li>
           <li>Clients need to be able to view data by campaign, publisher and creative</li>
           <li>It's time-consuming to switch in between multiple places in UI</li>
       </ul>

       <h5>Design</h5>
       <h6>Ideation</h6>
       <p>
           After I had a better understanding of user goals and behaviors, I did a quick exploration to make sure 
           I could fit a new dashboard into existing UI without breaking anything. I've researched which existing 
           UI components can be re-used and which ones require a low effort to modify. Next step was a paper 
           prototyping workshop with the product and R&D leadership to quickly figure out what is possible within 
           the timeframe and to make sure all the business goals are met.
       </p>

       <h6>Wireframing</h6>
       <p>
           After the collaborative session I've converted paper mock-up into a high fidelity wireframe. I've added 
           some interactivity to clarify all usage scenarios and edge cases. We've reviewed the results with the 
           Scrum team to make sure there are no red flags or anything that could cause significant delays.
       </p>

       <h6>Guerilla testing</h6>
       <p>
           While under a tight deadline, I've opted out to do guerrilla testing sessions. Using rough Invision 
           prototypes I've tested with internal super users to make sure our concept is easy to understand.
       </p>

       <h5>Implementation</h5>
       <p>
           I've worked with the Scrum team to appropriately break down the work for our team and identify the 
           dependancies. I've continued working closely with the team until the dashboard was launched.
       </p>

       <h5>Measuring Results</h5>
       <p>
           In order to inform improvements for the next SAFe increment I've decided track page visits in combination 
           with page interactions, retention rate and time spend on a page. After a few weeks of usage we scheduling 
           follow up interviews with super-users to get qualitative feedback.
