               <h5>Project Overview</h5>
               <div>
                   HLNtv.com is the digital home of HLN, CNN's sisters network. It is a large editorial site with more than 
                   40 new pieces of content published daily, including articles, video, galleries and interactives.
                   <br><br>
                   It is also home to a variety of HLN TV shows, such as Nancy Grace, Morning Express with Robin Meade, and 
                   Dr. Drew, as well as a number of original series.
                   <br><br>
                   Our team needed to completely redesign the website based on the network's new direction, its inefficient 
                   platform and mostly mobile audience. Working in a fast-paced environment, a small team dedicated to the 
                   project had to figure out how build a brand new site and CMS from scratch.
                   <br><br>
                   Working on an aggressive timeline, we met rapidly changing requirements from a large editorial team, TV show 
                   teams and ad sales, while keeping the user needs top of the mind.
               </div>

               <h5>My Role</h5>
               <p>
                   As the design lead on a multifunctional team, I worked closely with Product and Development to create the 
                   overall user experience of the new site and to design page templates, responsive reflow rules, visual styles 
                   and interface components.
                   <br>
                   I also helped define what the MVP would look like and collaborated with Product on gathering requirements by 
                   interviewing stakeholders and conducting Design Studio workshops.

           </div>
       </div>

       <div>
           I built and iterated wireframes, produced rapid prototypes and worked on designs for the entire site, including the 
           homepage, show pages, article page and a variety of supporting pages for mobile, tablet and desktop.
           <br><br>
           Along with the front-end developer, I established a style guide for the development team and external vendors. 
           Additionally, I monitored, refined and prioritized design stories in Pivotal Tracker, as well as approved releases 
           and trained editorial stuff to use the new CMS. I managed a team of junior and freelance designers, as well as their 
           day-to-day responsibilities.

               <h5>The Homepage</h5>
               <p>
                   This page was the biggest challenge to design and the biggest success. It is the face of the digital network 
                   and was particularly important to a number of internal clients, including editorial, business development and 
                   sales teams. Our team went through multiple designs in order to meet everyone's goals, all while keeping the 
                   external user of the site at the center of our vision.
               </p>

               <h5>Article Page</h5>
               <p>
                   The start of our entire project, the article page is essential to overall traffic flow of the site. Since most 
                   traffic to the site comes from social media, it was crucial for us to design the optimal article page experience 
                   on mobile. We took a modular approach to this page in order to give editorial more freedom with video, gallery 
                   and social media embeds.

       <h5>Show Pages</h5>
       <p>
           Because each show has its own identity, we wanted to make sure its page reflected it, despite all show pages having 
           a similar template. I communicated with each show to make sure their needs were met and guided the teams in populating 
           their show pages with show-specific content.
